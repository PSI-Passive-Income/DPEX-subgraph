# PSI Dex Subgraph

The Graph exposes a GraphQL endpoint to query the events and entities within the Binance Smart Chain and PSI Dex ecosystem.

Currently, there are multiple subgraphs, but additional subgraphs can be added to this repo:

1. **[Blocks](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/psi-passive-income/blocks)**: Tracks all the blocks on Binance Smart Chain.

2. **[Exchange](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/psi-passive-income/exchange)**: Tracks all PSI Dex Exchange data with price, volume, liquidity, ...

3. **[DexCandles](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/psi-passive-income/dex-candles)**: Tracks all the PSI Dex trades (event: `Swap`) with 5m / 15m / 1h / 4h / 1d / 1w candles.

## BSC errors

Graph has issues with indexing the bsc chain, so currently our graph schemes are not working as they should:

## To setup and deploy

For any of the subgraph: `blocks` as `[subgraph]`

1. Run the `yarn run codegen:[subgraph]` command to prepare the TypeScript sources for the GraphQL (generated/*).

2. Run the `yarn run build:[subgraph]` command to build the subgraph, and check compilation errors before deploying.

3. Run `graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'`

4. Deploy via `yarn run deploy:[subgraph]`.
